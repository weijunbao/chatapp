## ChatApp ##

ChatApp is the final year project done by Cijoe James and  Mary Ann.

The objective of this project is to create an XMPP chat application capable of connecting to any XMPP server like [Google Talk](http://talk.google.com). There is also an intend to add VOIP capabilities to the client - though we are not sure how we are going to do this right now :-).

ChatApp is a code name that we use, and the final version might have a different name.

ChatApp is written in DotNet and uses the XMPP library, SoapBox form [Coversant](http://www.coversant.com/).

### Status ###
